## What have I been upto lately?
 
- ### Joined under Tav Sir for a capstone project
	- I am really excited to start my project under [Dr. Tavpritesh Sethi](https://www.iiitd.ac.in/tavpritesh) or Tav(as we all call him ðŸ˜‰) Sir. Looking forward to learn and work under his guidance. 
	- Will be posting more updates about the capstone project and my experience soon.

	- A very innovating course being offered jointly by [Dr. Tavpritesh Sethi](https://www.iiitd.ac.in/tavpritesh) & [Dr. Ponnurangam Kumaraguru](https://www.iiitd.ac.in/pk). The course is really one of its kind and is being taught by two brilliant minds at [IIITD](https://www.iiitd.ac.in/).
