We all have to start somewhere. Every famous name today was once an amateur learner.
In a video, Code Stars by code.org, Tech Giants have discussed that we all have to start from scratch. We do not need to wait for a miracle to happen. All we need is determination and a strong will to take the first step. The hardest part of the journey is the first step. Once you have taken that, you are already halfway there.

&gt;“Expect problems and eat them for breakfast”
-Alfred A. Montapert

As we start our journey, we face many new and exciting challenges. And as we are faced with a problem, we ought to seek its solution. We learn the most when we search the solutions for our problems. This process of “being stuck &amp; seeking a solution”, is an indispensable part of learning.

&gt;“It’s not that I’m so smart, it’s just that I stay with problems longer.”
-Albert Einstein

I face many challenges when I sit down to try something new. I feel overjoyed as well as grateful when I see people who share their idea and work with the world. Blogs are like open source forums of art, ideas and freedom. They are the Stackoverflow of social writing with a liberty of saying anything you wish to. You can discuss whatever you want. You do not have to be bound to a particular question. There are questions and there are questions. All asked as well as answered by you. All original and unique, in your own way.

I want to share my ideas, my thoughts and opinions with others. I am well aware of the fact that I am no well-versed scholar or a wise philosopher. I have not seen life much unlike many of you people out there. But, I believe all these are not required to be a blogger. Blogging is stating what is in your mind, straight and simple. It is an effort to help others to find and learn from what you have to say. It is a trick to tell people what they should do and how they should feel when they have a similar thought or challenge as you are having right now.
With all these notions, I want to start blogging. I would be sharing all my problems and all solutions I will find with my people, who read my content. I promise. *smile* *wink*</content><author><name>Kamal Awasthi</name></author><category term="General" /><summary type="html">Well! let’s face this. We all have to start somewhere.
